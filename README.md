Description of Scripts

Scripts 1_mw_daily_sleep and 2_actigraphy_cleaning wrangle the EMA and actigraphy data
Scripts 3a and 3b have dates linked with participant id info; therefore, they will not be posted here.
Script 3c renames variables and combines the data completed at different timepoints with the output of a dataframe of all those who completed any at-home component (N=154). Descriptives of thsoe who completed the EMA and those who completed the actigraphy portion are included here.

Note that these samples are not independent. A little over half (55%) of the sample completed EMA and actigraphy at the same time (defined by at least 7 days of overlap). 12% completed EMA and actigraphy at different times (where there was little to no overlap). 25% completed _only_ actigraphy, and 8% completed _only_ EMA.
